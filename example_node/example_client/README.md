# Example Web App using MQTT Socket.io Server Bridge for Unity

This is the example node.js web app that uses the parent directory MQTT Socket.io server bridge

In this directory is the app.js that listens for http on port 5000 and communicates with the Socket.io server on port 3000.

This is a rough low level client that should be used to build real clients.

## Pre-requisites

a working node.js environment  

## Installation

In the example_node directory run "npm install ."

## Execution

Start the app - node.app.js

Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000
Click on an online device.
