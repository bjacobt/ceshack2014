# AT&T Developer Summit 2014 Hackathon Unity Sensor Network

Welcome to the 2014 AT&T Developer Summit Hackathon

Deployed in the room are 7 sensor kits named ceshack-pi01 to ceshack-pi07

These kits are broadcasting in realtime the following sensor data:

* Light
* Humidity
* Temperature
* Alcohol Levels
* Carbon Monoxide Levels
* Acceleration - X, Y, Z planes
* Magnetic Fields - X, Y, Z planes

On each device is also an iBeacon

See this data presented live here - http://socketio.ceshack2014.att.io:5000/meter.html#

If you select one of the devices then you can take a picture and control the attached fan

To learn how to read the data and control the devices yourselves please see here - http://socketio.ceshack2014.att.io/instructions/

The data is also streamed live into http://m2x.att.com

To the team that uses the data the most creatively to create an experience that we could not see before. Use your imagination. e.g. the room is a retail space and the kits are in different departments.  Or the kits are in different peoples house's etc...

Welcome to the Internet of NOW! and good luck
